The *geometricVoFCartesian* is an extension library for simulating two-phase flows in OpenFOAM. It features conventional and machine-learning models to estimate the normal vector and curvature of the fluid-fluid interfaces in geometric Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) framework. 

## General Description
The methods are designed for uniform (isotropic) Cartesian grids. In cases where the interface motion occurs in a smaller subset of the domain, the uniform grid can also be restricted to a smaller zone containing the interface. This is currently achieved using the cellSet functionality. The rest of the domain can use generic unstructured grids. 

Available methods are as follows:
- **Interface normal vector**: Youngs' Method, Central-Columns Differences Method, Mixed Youngs-Central (MYC) Method
- **Interface curvature**: Height Function Method, Multilayer-Perceptron (MLP) models (only in 2D currently)

### Fundamental Classes
- **ijkZone**: Creation and manipulation of the regular-grid zone containing the interface motions.
- **multilayerPerceptron**: Basic functionalities and data structures for an MLP. Implementation is done only using the C++ Standard Library. Thus, no additional package is required to use new machine learning models.  
- **uniformStencil**: Parallel operations on local cell blocks.
- **interfaceForce**: Base class for new curvature models.


### Solver
**interIsoCartFoam**: Extension to *interIsoFoam* to feature newly implemented schemes.

### Machine Learning
Machine learning models employ deep MLP architectures to estimate the interfacial curvarture. Models are developed in three steps. First, a synthetic dataset composed of either circular arcs of varying sizes is generated. Subsequently, about hundred MLPs are trained in Tensorflow using synthetic datasets composed of either circles or waves of varying sizes. Subsequently,the weights and biases of Tensorflows models are converted to ascii format. Finally, a newly implemented MLP class in OpenFOAM reads these parameters and constructs the corresponding MLP model. 


## Example 
Benchmark cases are provided in soon.
