An extension library containing new neural-network based interface reconstruction schemes and surface tension models for two-phase flow simulations in OpenFOAM.  

## Description
The methods are designed for uniform Cartesian grids. In cases where the interface is restricted to a subset of the domain, e.g., deep water waves, the uniform grid can also be restricted to a smaller zone containing the interface. This is currently achieved using the cellSet functionality. The rest of the domain can use unstructured grids. Such an approach offers the best of both worlds: the accuracy and speed of Cartesian methods around the interface where they are needed, and the flexibility of the unstructured grids elsewhere. 

In addition to neural-network models, several popular schemes are also implemented: (i) interface normal: Young's method, central-columns differences, mixed Young-central method; (ii) interface curvature: height function method.

## Example 
An example for gravity-capillary waves is provided. More examples and benchmark cases will follow.

## Prerequisites
OpenFOAM v2006.
