### Machine Learning
Machine learning models employ deep MLP architectures to estimate the interfacial curvarture. The code to develop these models can be found in tensorflow directory. Models are developed in three steps:
1. A synthetic dataset composed of circular arcs of varying sizes is generated with *tensorflow/scripts/genCircles.sh*.
2. Models are trained with mini-batch optimization using the script *tensorflow/scripts/mlpTrain.sh*.
3. The best performing models are selected, and the weights and biases of these Tensorflows models are converted to standard ascii format. The *multilayerPerceptron* class in OpenFOAM reads these parameters and co\
nstructs the corresponding MLP model.
